## My process

---

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build Tool

### What I learned

---

This project was my first attempt at using Tailwind CSS after working with plain CSS. I decided to use Tailwind's Grid system instead of Flexbox for this layout, which gave me the opportunity to learn and apply this feature for the first time. Additionally, I made some customizations to the config file to improve the code's readability and organization.

I found Tailwind's unique syntax to be the most challenging aspect of this project, but I believe this is a normal learning curve when trying out a new technology.
